/**
 * This class represents a MAPI %session with the Exchange Server
 *
 * The %session is best thought of as the connection by a single user to a
 * single server. It is possible to have multiple sessions open at the same
 * time.
 *
 * A key concept in the %session is that of a \em profile, and the %profile
 * database. The %profile is a pre-established data set that specifies the
 * server information (e.g. server name / IP address, and Exchange domain)
 * and client information (e.g. the user name, preferred language, and
 * optionally the users password). The profiles are stored in a local store
 * (Samba LDB database) known as the %profile store or %profile database. One
 * of the profiles in the %profile database can be designated as the default
 * %profile (which is particularly useful given that most users may only have
 * one). See the profile class documentation for more information.
 *
 * The general concept is that you create a %session %object, log in to the
 * %session using a selected %profile name, and then work with the message_store
 * associated with that %session. The message_store is only valid so long
 * as the session is valid.
