/**
\mainpage %mapitest documentation

%mapitest acts as stand-alone torture test of a range of MAPI function
calls. It is intended to validate the implementation of various
functions, and to ensure that existing functionality does not suffer
regression between releases.

As a general principle, %mapitest calls should leave the system in the
same state at the end as at the start - it is meant to clean up after
itself.
